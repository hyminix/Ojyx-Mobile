-- Fixed Migration: Change rooms.creator_id from text to uuid
-- Date: 2025-07-28
-- Task: #43 - Migration corrig√©e

BEGIN;

-- Step 1: Add temporary column
ALTER TABLE rooms ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS creator_id_uuid uuid;

-- Step 2: Convert existing data
UPDATE rooms 
SET creator_id_uuid = creator_id::uuid
WHERE creator_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 3: Drop ALL dependent policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Room creator can delete room" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Room participants can update room" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "View waiting rooms or joined rooms" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can create rooms" ON rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view rooms" ON rooms;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in room can create game states" ON game_states;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in room can update game states" ON game_states;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in room can view game states" ON game_states;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in game can manage player grids" ON player_grids;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in game can insert actions" ON game_actions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in game can view actions" ON game_actions;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players can delete scores in their rooms" ON global_scores;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view global scores" ON global_scores;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert scores" ON global_scores;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "update_players_policy" ON players;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in room can insert events" ON room_events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in room can view events" ON room_events;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in game can view cards" ON cards_in_play;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Players in game can view decks" ON decks;

-- Step 4: Drop the view that depends on creator_id
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_rls_violations_monitor;

-- Step 5: Drop old column and rename new one
ALTER TABLE rooms DROP COLUMN creator_id;
ALTER TABLE rooms RENAME COLUMN creator_id_uuid TO creator_id;

-- Step 6: Add foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE rooms 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_rooms_creator_id 
FOREIGN KEY (creator_id) 
REFERENCES players(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Step 7: Recreate ALL policies with correct uuid type
